On any given week, teachers and/or parents leverage our product, Mystery Science, to help their children stay curious. Roughly 2 million kids view our content on a weekly basis alone. While we are proud of this accomplishment, we have an ambitious goal of reaching every elementary school student in the country. In short, we are growing quickly and with growth...comes lots of data!
As a Data Scientist at Mystery.org, you will be granted the freedom to use your data analytics and experimentation skills across the organization. You'll join a 4 person Growth team made up of 2 other data scientists, a lead growth engineer, and our Director of Growth. You¡¯ll work cross-functionally to answer our most important questions by innovating and uncovering breakthroughs.
You will report to Huey Kwik, our Director of Growth. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is open to both local and remote US-based candidates.

About You
Can you translate questions from non-technical stakeholders into decisions that can be answered with data?
Can you communicate complicated/foreign concepts or methodology to non-experts?
Are you familiar with Python? Numerical & analytical programming (i.e. pandas, scipy, etc)? SQL? Experimentation?
Do you have basic proficiency in statistics and statistical modeling?
Do you have experience, knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas: Practical A/B testing for websites, feature engineering, predictive modeling (including using models in production), familiarity with machine learning algorithms?
About Mystery.org

At Mystery.org, we believe it¡¯s important that children stay curious as they grow up. We will ensure that the next generation sees it¡¯s an amazing world we live in, full of possibility and wonder ¡ª and that they learn how to figure things out for themselves.

We¡¯re doing this by building the missing internet for children. Our first tool was created for children to use in the classroom. We have teachers signed up from 89% of elementary schools in the U.S. and now 50% of schools use us every month. We¡¯ve created one of the fastest-growing learning resources and a brand that is loved by children. Now, we¡¯re developing a new version of our product for parents and children to use at home.

For three years running, our sales have doubled. We¡¯ve exceeded $10M in annual recurring revenue and are growing quickly.

When we talk about ¡°the missing internet for children,¡± we intend to give children an experience that grownups take for granted: the ability to instantly explore anything they wonder about. Most adults don't realize how inaccessible knowledge is to children. For their first ten years of life, any time a child wonders something all they can do is ask grownups: parents at home and teachers at school. There are 1 billion children in the world today, and we¡¯re making it possible for them to explore their questions, wherever they are. Over the past decade, grownups have been given this superpower but children have been left behind. So we're collecting every question children ask and creating video explanations for all of them. We think this will be the most important learning tool ever created.

Meet The Team

On your first day at Mystery.org, you¡¯ll meet a group of 50 people who are passionate about learning and who each love their respective crafts. Our co-founder, Doug Peltz, began by assembling a team of the best explainers in the world from the Exploratorium, Klutz, Stanford, the Field Museum, and leading private schools. Our CEO, Keith Schacht, followed this by building a team of strong product engineers and designers. Keith was previously at Facebook as the product manager for News Feed and Messenger.

We have a strong focus on people that extends to every area of the company. We¡¯re building the team that we want to work with.

The team at Mystery.org believes in the power of diversity and we hope you do too! We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.

Pinterest brings millions of people the inspiration to create a life they love. To evolve this mission our product and engineering teams need to innovate. The key to understanding how innovation on the product will change our business is through measurement, and the faster we can evaluate these ideas, the faster we can innovate. Experimentation is at the core of this evaluation - and both implicit (obtaining feedback from pinners through their engagement with changes) and explicit (obtaining labels from human evaluators or Pinners on questions about the content or change) signals can be used to evaluate the success of the idea.

Teams within Pinterest run thousands of such experiments each year, but there is a substantial opportunity to improve the value derived from each experiment and the speed at which we unlock this value; impact in this space transforms both the productivity of our teams and the speed of innovation at the company. We are looking for a highly technical Data Scientist who is passionate about driving innovation to join a small team of data scientists to shape and evolve our experimentation tooling and our culture of experimentation.

What you¡¯ll do:
Solve key challenges in the experimentation space - from increasing the sensitivity of measurement - to developing techniques that shed insight into why an experiment did not perform as expected - to shaping the metrics we use to measure the value a new product innovation will provide to Pinners or advertisers
Collaborate with data scientists, engineers and product partners to build and evolve the tools that enable us to evaluate and interpret experimental data at scale
Understand our opportunity for improvement by analyzing data across thousands of past experiments to identify patterns and insights that determine the problems we tackle next
Shape and evolve the culture of experimentation across the company through a well-articulated understanding of the limitations in place today and the value that will be derived from change
What we¡¯re looking for:
Advanced degree in a quantitative field with 4+ years of industry experience and a proven track record of applying statistical methods to solve real-world problems using big data
Experience working with experimentation, measurement or human evaluation platforms and a past experience related to the evolution of these platforms

at Vectra AI

San Jose, CA

 Vectra delivers a new class of real-time threat detection and advanced analysis of active network intrusions. Vectra picks up where perimeter security leaves off using AI to provide deep, continuous analysis of both internal and Internet-facing network traffic for all phases of the attack progression as attackers attempt to breach, spy, spread, and steal within networks.

 Vectra directly analyzes network traffic in real time using combination of patent-pending data science, machine learning, and behavioral analysis to detect attacker behaviors and user anomalies in the network. All detections are algorithmically correlated and prioritized to show an attack in context, and Vectra Networks' machine learning adapts as attacks evolve.

Position Overview:

Apply cutting edge machine learning, artificial intelligence, and modeling techniques to stop hackers in real time as they attack networks. As part of the data science internship program, you will directly impact the product by developing new methods using cutting edge techniques to detect malicious and anomalous behaviors on the network.

 We are looking for qualified undergraduate and graduate interns eager to learn and deliver a project that will be used in the product

 Qualifications:
Undergraduate or Graduate major focusing on Computer Science, Engineering, or similar computational discipline
Python programming experience
Strong machine learning knowledge and/or mathematical foundations with experience solving tough, real-world problems
