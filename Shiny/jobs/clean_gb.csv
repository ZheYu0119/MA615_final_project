            At Radius, we deal with a number of very large data sets, the largest of which is our detailed telemetry for the vehicles we track.
These vehicles cover hundreds of millions of miles per month and we record every significant piece of driver behaviour data we can capture during those journeys, as well as recording the location, speed and heading of the vehicle at regular intervals.
This data set has created the need for new tools, practices and processes.  We are making use of data science, machine learning and interactive visualisations to gather insights from this data, in order to build better products and innovate for our customers.   We also use these same technologies to develop our product strategy internally.  We recently presented our work on using unsupervised machine learning to process our fuel station data and to visualise our market share.
Technologies we use for our work with data include:
Cassandra
Apache Spark
ActiveMQ
Python
Pandas
AWS S3, Redshift, Lambda
Tableau
Key to our success in applying these technologies to our rapidly growing, innovative organisation, are the people we employ.
We are currently recruiting for data engineers and data scientists with experience of Apache Spark and ML.
If you like working on challenging problems in interesting domains, with a focus on innovation, then I'd like to speak to you.

Ofcom would also sponsor membership of relevant professional organisations, such as the Royal Statistical Society and the Market Research Society. 
 
Ofcom also offers a large internal training programme to support colleague development. 
 
Skills: 
 
During your two years on the programme, we offer placements moving between projects, industry sectors and departments within Ofcom, exposing you to a range of knowledge and insight. You will primarily be placed within the market research team working both with research and intelligence colleagues. Possible placements include Spectrum, the Data and Innovation Hub, the Economics Group, and the Technology team or externally with one of our research agencies from our Framework.

The Company


causaLens is pioneering Causal AI, a new category of intelligent machines that understand cause and effect - a major step towards true AI. Its enterprise platform is used to transform leading businesses in Finance, IoT, Energy, Telecommunications and others.
Current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, have severe limitations when applied to real world business problems and fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. For instance, in the case of predictions, they severely overfit and do not adapt when the environment changes. causaLens¡¯ Causal AI Platform goes beyond predictions, providing transparent causal insights and suggesting actions that directly improve business KPIs.
causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. Contact us on info@causaLens.com or follow us on<U+00A0>LinkedIn<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>Twitter.


We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

 Data Scientist, Economist
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
 
About the Role
As an Economist in the Data Science organisation at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters. Using experimental or observational data, you will get to help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour? 
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants? 
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor¡¯s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the Delivery food market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behavior?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company. 
 
Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business-relevant economic problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Masters degree or PhD (preferred) in Economics or Econometrics
Ideally industry experience since the completion of your academic career
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
Ability to understand and design markets and incentives taking into account the information environment and strategic interactions
Excellent people skills ¡ª you¡¯ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into economic problems.

 Overview 
 
Ofcom is at the cutting edge of emerging communications from broadcasting on TV and radio, to telecoms and how we communicate with each other, to new wireless technologies. Our graduates play a key role in all of these areas. Join us, and you can get involved from the start. 
 
On the graduate scheme, you will embark on a two-year series of intensive job placements, moving regularly between projects and departments to ensure that the knowledge and insight you are exposed to is as broad as possible. So, one week you might be analysing terabytes of network performance data; the next, using AI techniques to look for patterns in broadcast content. On successful completion of the two-year scheme you will make the transition into a permanent role in one of the business areas relevant to your chosen pathway. 
 
Data in Ofcom 
 
Data underpins much of Ofcom¡¯s work as an evidence-based regulator. Data specialists work across our organisation, extracting insights and informing our policy and operational work. Ofcom¡¯s Data Innovation Hub supports these colleagues, and the development of our data capability more broadly. This team fulfils three functions: 
 
Delivering a step change in our capability to organise, manage, understand and extract insights from data, by developing innovative tools and improving our knowledge; 
 Helping colleagues across the organisation deliver their policy or organisational priorities by undertaking targeted projects involving the analysis or visualisation of data; and 
 Providing advice to data specialists throughout the organisation. 
The Role 
 
As a Data Science and Engineering graduate you will have the opportunity to work within the Data Innovation Hub and with data and information technology specialists in other groups across the organisation. You will have the opportunity to use and further develop your data science and engineering skills on projects across all of our sectors, such as broadband and mobile networks, radio spectrum engineering, market research and audio/video content. 
 
We have a culture of continuous learning, so you will be able to benefit from a range of training opportunities, ranging from e-learning modules, internal or external classroom-based courses, hackathons and on-the-job learning. You will also be supported by senior data scientists and engineers and you will be mentored throughout your time on the graduate programme.

 Data Scientist, Algorithms
Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the Role
In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants. We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation powered by our world class experimentation platform.
We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Previous experience applying machine learning/operations research to business problems in industry
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development. Deploying models to production and experiment monitoring is a bonus. 
Solid communication skills - in person, in writing, in code, and code-review; to technical and non-technical audiences
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
A pragmatic approach, biased to simplicity, where you most care about achieving impactBenefits and Diversity 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of scaling up one of the most exciting companies in tech.

            About UsInsurance is the single biggest industry in the world ¨C there are more insurance policies than people. But seven in ten people say they think their insurer is actively trying to cheat them, and only 13% say they actually trust their insurer (and that¡¯s according to the industry¡¯s own representative body, the ABI). It consistently ranks as one of the least trusted, least recommendable industries on the planet. How can such a massive, ubiquitous thing be so fundamentally broken ¨C and how can we help fix it?We're Hiro, and we're building something we call smart insurance. We¡¯re trying to make something that's exciting, intuitive, rewarding, maybe even fun - and there for you every day; not just if you need a pay-out. Insurance that¡¯s personalised to you, and works with you to actively protect the things you care about instead of just sitting back and waiting for bad things to happen. It¡¯s everything your old insurance isn¡¯t, in other words.We¡¯re an ambitious, energetic startup and we¡¯ve already built some things we think are pretty exciting.

As well as developing our ability to model risk and price products, you¡¯ll be helping us join the dots in areas like fraud detection, recommendation and personalisation ¨C anywhere the data tells a story. Ideally you¡¯ll understand how to visualise that complex analysis as creative assets so you can communicate it to other parts of the business.You¡¯ll be leading our data science department as we take Hiro from our first few beta testers to a national audience ¨C so that means all the autonomy, all the creative freedom, and a lot of responsibility. You¡¯ll likely have the opportunity to hand-pick and lead a team of other brilliant data scientists as we grow. If you¡¯ve got intensity and discipline and the idea of owning and spearheading groundbreaking research gets you excited, you¡¯re in the right place.The successful candidate will have a strong mix of the below.- Strong track record applying data science or quantitative / statistical analysis in a commercial role. You understand how to translate business needs into your own research exercises, and vice versa, how to output findings we can use. Bonus points for a background in financial services.- Experience mining, accessing and analysing large datasets using languages / tools like Python, R, SQL, C/C++, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Rapid Miner¡­ realistically, you¡¯ll be telling us what tools you want to use.

We are for everyone
MHCLG want to bring in and bring on a diverse workforce at all levels. 
Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system ¨C this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise). 
Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions for example all candidates¡¯ responses to ¡®Seeing the Big Picture¡¯ rather than seeing a candidate¡¯s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible. 
Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors. 
When writing your application, remember: 
The assessor won¡¯t be reading your answers sequentially. 
Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers. 
If talking about something in your first answer, make sure that you write the second answer as if you had not written the first (and so on!)

 We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!
You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.
We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.
The Data & Customer Operations teams
The data team's mission is to
Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster
This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.
For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You¡¯ll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.
The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that¡¯s what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.
The role
The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.
A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We¡¯re looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.
What¡¯s special about data at Monzo?
Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.
Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.
Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there¡¯s some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.
 
You should apply if:
What we¡¯re doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You¡¯re comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
We offer share options and competitive salaries based on skills and experience, which could be anywhere between ¡ê49,000 - ¡ê80,000 per year. 
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. 
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us ¨C if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
About the Role
We are looking for a senior data science manager to join our management team. We are looking for someone who:
Has experience managing data science managers as well as individual contributors.
Has experience being a data scientist at a mid/senior level, but is now not looking to do individual contributor work.
Has experience working with C-level stakeholders, as well as other stakeholders business wide.
Is able to set company level strategy.
Is able to bring together a group of individuals from many different backgrounds and skill sets to form a cohesive team.
Is comfortable managing multiple teams in different business areas, and ruthlessly prioritising.
Is comfortable working in an extremely fast, constantly changing environment, with incredibly high standards.
Has a pragmatic, flexible approach, and most cares about achieving impact.
Life at DeliverooWe are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
Benefits and Diversity 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

 Data Scientist
About the Role
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
As a data scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like:
Which markets/cities should we enter next?
How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps?
How can we incentivise good rider behaviour? 
What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants? 
How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo?
How does a new competitor¡¯s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players?
What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them?
How should we make investment decisions company-wide?
How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order?
Which restaurants should we show a given customer?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area?
What impact do online reviews have?
How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?
The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.
 
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind?
At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
 
Qualifications:
Always curious and willing to learn new skills
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
A problem solver with a deep analytical mindset
Ability to think creatively and insightfully about business problems
A critical thinker with very strong attention to detail
Proficiency with analytical tools like R/Python and familiarity with SQL
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Excellent people skills ¡ª you¡¯ll be meeting with stakeholders to translate business needs into data science problems

 Senior Data Scientist, Algorithms
At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
 
About the role
In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.
We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.
We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. 
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Benefits and Diversity 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

 Staff Data Scientist, Algorithms
Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. 
 
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
 
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making. 
 
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors. 
About the Role
In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.
 
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
 
We are looking for a staff data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
 
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays 
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes 
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
 
We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation powered by our world class experimentation platform.
Requirements:
Able to assess and prioritise areas of algorithmic impact across multiple product groups.
Demonstrable experience designing and developing impactful algorithms at current place of work.
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development. Deploying models to production and experiment monitoring is a bonus. 
Solid communication skills - in person, in writing, in code, and code-review; to technical and non-technical audiences
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
A pragmatic approach, biased to simplicity, where you most care about achieving impact
Benefits and Diversity 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.
 
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of scaling up one of the most exciting companies in tech.

Data Science at DeliverooWe are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Benefits and DiversityAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

 Data Scientist, Causal Inference
About the RoleAt Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
At Deliveroo we¡¯re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we¡¯re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.
Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we¡¯re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We¡¯re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.
Some of the problems we¡¯re working to solve:
How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?
How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?
How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?
How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?
How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?
How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?
Responsibilities:
Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation. 
Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods
Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances
Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team
Qualifications:
PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics
Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods 
Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset
Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. 
Benefits and Diversity 
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

2. About ECMWF 
 
ECMWF is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States. ECMWF carries out scientific and technical research directed to the improvement of its forecasts, collects and processes large amounts of observations, and manages a long-term archive of meteorological data. Satellite and in situ observations provide the information for up-to-date global analyses and climate reanalyses of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. 
 
For details, see www.ecmwf.int/. 
 
ECMWF has been entrusted to operate the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) on behalf of the European Commission until the end of 2020 and is preparing plans for the follow-up Copernicus Programme activities (2021-2027). Copernicus is the European Union (EU) flagship Earth-observation programme. The Copernicus programme ensures operational monitoring of the atmosphere, oceans, and continental surfaces, and provides reliable, validated information services for a range of environmental and security applications. Based on the exploitation of space based and in situ observations and models, Copernicus provides information services for land, marine, atmospheric and climate monitoring, as well as emergency management and security. For details, see www.copernicus.eu/. 
The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) service provides consistent and quality-controlled information related to air pollution and health, solar energy, greenhouse gases and climate forcing, everywhere in the world. For details, see www.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/ 
The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) service provides authoritative information about the past, present and future climate, as well as tools to enable climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies by policy makers and businesses. For details, see www.climate.copernicus.eu/ 
 
3. Summary of the role 
 
As part of the Copernicus programme, ECMWF is leading the development and implementation of an exciting new Earth monitoring service to monitor anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4 and various air pollutants. Converting satellite observations of atmospheric concentrations into emission estimates requires the development and implementation of novel hybrid-4D-Var data assimilation techniques to extend the capabilities of the current ECMWF data assimilation systems. 
The role will support the development and testing of these new capabilities and carry out the technical efforts towards their seamless implementation in the ECMWF data assimilation system aligned with the broader development of the OOPS (Object-Oriented Prediction System) framework. OOPS is a unified, easy-to-use framework for running different variational data assimilation formulations with a variety of forecast models and is replacing the control layer of data assimilation code that has supported ECMWF for the past 20 years. The new emission monitoring capabilities will include parameter and flux estimation for anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric species including CO2. The Scientist will work in a small team but also collaborate with other ECMWF teams. 
The position is in the Earth System Assimilation Section of the Research Department. The Scientist will work in the Data Assimilation Methodology team and will be co-managed by the CAMS Development Section in the Copernicus Department. 
The position is funded by the H2020 <U+0093>Prototype system for a Copernicus CO2 service<U+0094> project (CoCO2), which is coordinated by ECMWF and supports the European Commission with building the prototype system of a future Copernicus CO2 anthropogenic emissions monitoring system.

            Join one of Europe¡¯s leading Fintech startupsiwoca is breaking down the barriers that stop Europe¡¯s 20 million small businesses from accessing finance. We believe finance should make life easier, not harder, for small businesses. When small businesses go to traditional lenders they are forced to deal with long waits, absurdly rigid criteria, and impersonal bureaucracies. We believe small businesses deserve a financing service that strips out the hassle; that gets to know each customer¡¯s needs; that generates opportunities instead of problems. iwoca is finance, custom-built to expand possibilities for small business.We¡¯re still near the start of our journey ¨C our aim is to finance one million small businesses within a decade and we need more smart, hands-on people to help us reach this goal.We work hard to make iwoca a place where everyone feels welcome, where you can confidently be yourself. We understand that diversity isn't an optional add-on, it's the core ingredient of what makes us great.We are looking for Data Scientists from strong analytical backgrounds that can take potentially ambiguous, real-world business problems and formulate statistical solutions, which can be implemented in a pragmatic way. We¡¯re looking for people who understand the limitations and assumptions of such a modelling process and can generate actionable insights and build effective predictive models.About us: High calibre and diverse team of data scientists with a range of expertise. All members of the team have strong analytical backgrounds in Physics, Mathematics, Engineering etc, some with PhDs in their respective field. Broad and significant engagement in all steps of the problem solving process, including specification, solution proposal, implementation and delivery. Our development cycle is tight and incorporates elements of Agile processes, which means features or projects go live in days or weeks rather than months or years. We value personal development, constructive feedback, sharing knowledge and trying innovative solutions to problems. What do we do?: Application of statistical modelling and machine learning techniques. Delivery of data driven solutions and predictions for a diverse range of business problems, including risk assessment and contact prioritisation. Development of real-time data pipelining and delivery of ML predictions. A/B testing and data analysis using statistical methods to generate insights and optimise existing and future business processes. Multi-disciplinary projects with the wider tech team and business stakeholders. Requirements Strong analytical background, e.g PhD or degree in Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related field; or equivalent experience. Good understanding of the techniques used in statistical data analysis, ability to generate well founded insights from potentially unstructured data. Some practical application of predictive modelling and pragmatic implementation of machine learning techniques to effectively solve real-world problems is a bonus. Someone that isn't satisfied with just applying out-of-the-box models, you want to know how they work, when they work and why they work. Some practical object-oriented programming experience: Python, Java, C/C++ or similar. Experience with some of the common Python data-science toolkits: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn is a bonus. Experience with R, Matlab, and/or SQL would be beneficial. Self-starter with ability to work autonomously in a relatively unconstrained environment. A healthy skepticism and desire to build innovative, but practical, solutions to business problems.

An Overview of the Role 
 

The Insights practice is part of Capgemini¡¯s global Insights & Data group; our goal is to help the organisations we work with become truly ¡®insight driven¡¯, to fully exploit their data using the convergence of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence to deliver real business value.  We marry the most innovative insights solutions with rock solid, industrialised engineering.




The role
 

Collaboration/InnovationIf we believed all the stories about AI, then we¡¯d be looking for budding magicians, wizards and sorcerers; but we don¡¯t.  So, whilst the reality is still, quite frankly, amazing, that¡¯s achieved through a lot of ¡®smarts¡¯, rather than magic fairy dust.  We want passionate, energetic people who live and breathe all things AI, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and so on, combined with great software engineering skills¡­no point creating great models if we can¡¯t deploy them!  We want you to be thinking ¡°how can I use what I know?¡±, ¡°what do I need to learn?¡± in order to help your client achieve their business goals. We take career progression seriously; many of the Insights & Data UK management and the Smart Analytics practice leads did not join in senior positions, rather they were given the opportunities from within to progress.  We really do try to balance the needs of the business with the needs and aspirations of the individual¡­it is in our interests for our people to be happy and successful.




The work
 

We don¡¯t really have a typical day or typical project at Capgemini.  Our clients expect advise, proof-of-values, industrialised solutions; we work on small and very large engagements and we work across several different sectors, including public, CPG, retail, manufacturing and utilities.  If you aren¡¯t on a project, you could instead be involved in a bid, doing some training, working on a point-of-view, building a demo or contributing to our blog series (tips from recent new joiners, who we are happy for you to speak with, is just ¡®get stuck in¡¯).  In recent months, we¡¯ve done some pretty cool stuff, like used Tensor Flow in a model looking at acoustics of voice recordings, used ESA radar data to classify UK vegetation and massive scale Spark for image processing at an O&G client.  




Why You?
 

We are looking to bring in people at all levels, so whilst the list of skills below is fairly heavy, please do get in touch even if you only have two or three.
Detailed knowledge on a range of AI techniques (e.g. supervised and un-supervised machine learning techniques, deep learning, graph data analytics, statistical analysis, time series, geospatial, NLP, sentiment analysis, pattern detection, etc.)
Experience using Python, R or Spark to extract insights from data
Knowledge of SQL for accessing and processing data (PostgreSQL preferred but general SQL knowledge more important)
Experience using the latest Data Science platforms (e.g. Databricks, Dataiku, AzureML, SageMaker) and frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, MXNet, scikit-learn)
Software engineering practices (coding practices to DS, unit testing, version control, code review)
Hadoop (especially the Cloudera and Hortonworks distributions), other NoSQL (especially Neo4j and Elastic), and streaming technologies (especially Spark Streaming)
Alchemy, spell casting and potion making
Deep understanding of data manipulation/wrangling techniques
Experience using development and deployment technologies, for instance virtualisation and management (e.g. Vagrant, Virtualbox), continuous integration tools (e.g. Jenkins, Concourse, Drone, Bamboo), configuration management tooling (e.g. Ansible) and containerisation technologies (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm)
Delivering insights using visualisation tools or libraries (Javascript preferred)
Experience building and deploying solutions to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) including Cloud provisioning tools (e.g. Terraform)
Strong interpersonal skills with the ability to work with clients to establish requirements in non-technical language.
Ability to translate business requirements into plausible technical solutions for articulation to other development staff.
Experience designing Data Science deliveries, planning projects and/or leading team
Why Us?
 

While we¡¯re a global consultancy, we¡¯re made up of supportive, close-knit communities. Everyone wants to get the best solutions for our customers and create the best working environment.
UpskillingPotential is just as important to us as having the required skills. If you have the right mindset, we might be able to provide you with bespoke training. So if you¡¯re not sure you have all the skills you need, but you¡¯re still passionate about the role, please apply and we¡¯ll see if we can support you.
Diversity
Capgemini positively encourages applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or belief, marital status, or pregnancy and maternity. We are committed to hiring, developing and retaining the best people to deliver innovative, world-class solutions for our clients. We foster an inclusive culture that enables everyone to achieve their full potential and enjoy a fulfilling career with us. Our comprehensive flexible benefits package and lifestyle policies enable our employees to balance their individual, family and work-life needs.

We are for everyone
MHCLG want to bring in and bring on a diverse workforce at all levels. 
Our application system is designed to remove as much bias as possible from the recruitment system ¨C this means that a hiring manager does not know your name, your details, see your whole application in one go (or have your CV at review stage unless stated otherwise). 
Your answers are randomised and chunked up. This means that each assessor views sets of responses to questions for example all candidates¡¯ responses to ¡®Seeing the Big Picture¡¯ rather than seeing a candidate¡¯s full application. The science behind this is that recruitment can be subject to ordering and fatigue effects and we want to reduce this as much as possible. 
Most of our campaigns utilise multiple assessors and so it is possible that each of your answers would be viewed by different assessors.
When writing your application, remember:
<U+2022> The assessor won¡¯t be reading your answers sequentially. 
<U+2022> Do not assume that the same assessors will have read all of your answers.

About UKHO 
 
UKHO is an executive agency, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. We work with a wide range of data partners to chart the world's oceans in order to develop and serve world leading software and data solutions to commercial shipping companies, navies and maritime organisations. Our products ensure safe navigation and global trade efficiency and support other marine activities including economic development, environmental protection, resource exploration and utilisation, scientific research and security and defence. 
 
The role 
 
Our customers require professional advice and a range of situational awareness products providing information about the marine environment to assist in their planning. To support this, the Ocean Environment Team within the Scientific Analysis Group, acquires data from a variety of sources and analyses this data for subsequent use. 
 
The purpose of this post is to provide the expertise necessary to advise on the use of environmental data and development to provide an assessment of the environmental conditions likely to be encountered. This will be achieved through: 
 
Collaborations with NGO/scientific communities; 
 Undertaking analysis of ocean environmental data to derive representative visualisations of the expected marine environmental conditions; 
 Developing a good understanding of customer needs; 
 Continuously reviewing methodology and working practices in order to provide a better service, more efficiently. 
What we are looking for 
 
We are seeking an outward looking marine scientist with a specialism in Marine Biology who is able to apply scientific concepts and advances to meet real world customer needs. The ability to develop supporting skills in data programming/data analysis to meet the evolving needs of our customers is key to success in the role, as is a genuine desire to work collaboratively as part of a small, dynamic team. To be successful in your application you will need to evidence the following essential criteria: 
 
Strong mathematical ability and a deep knowledge and understanding of the principles of marine environmental science - a postgraduate qualification or equivalent experience in marine biological science. 
 A working knowledge of data analysis and databasing techniques applied to marine environmental data, including computer programming skills (preferably some experience with MATLAB/R/Python alongside shell-scripting). 
 An understanding of data presentation and visualisation techniques and the ability to apply that to marine environmental data. 
And in return? 
 
UKHO is a great place in which to explore your career potential and offers a wealth of training and development opportunities. While our projects are career-defining, the work/life balance that we can offer you is equally exceptional. From flexitime, flexible working, an award-winning office environment, wellbeing schemes, a generous annual leave allowance, and access to MOD and Civil service discounts, the opportunities open to you here are hard to beat.

 Senior Data Scientist - Customer Care Workforce ManagementData Science at DeliverooAt Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we¡¯re always looking for new ideas and we¡¯re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven¡¯t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the RoleThe central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results 
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce 
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers 
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff
 
It's a bonus if you have:
Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
 
Benefits and Diversity At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.
